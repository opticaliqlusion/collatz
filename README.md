#  "Strong" Generalization of the Collatz Conjecture

This script tests a generalization of the Collatz conjecture, what I'm calling "Strong" Collatz reduction.

Recall the classic Collatz conjecture removes the prime $2$ if $x \equiv 0 \pmod 2$ otherwise $C_3(x) = 3x+1$. The classic conjecture states that any integer reduced in this manner eventually reduces to $1$ under iteration.

The idea under "strong" reduction is to remove **all** primes smaller than the $C_n x + 1$ coefficient. We will attempt to calculate which coefficents "converge" in the same manner as the classic formula.

In the Strong generalization, $3x+1$ is $C_3$, and removes the small primes $p = \set{2}$. Larger coefficients, such as $C_5$, remove all primes congruent $x$ smaller than C, that is $p=\set{2,3}$. $C_5$ not only divides $x$ by $2$ if it is even, but also divides $x$ by $3$ if $x \equiv 0 \pmod 3$.

Furthermore, $C_7$ is:

$C_7(x) = x / 5$ if $x \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$

$C_7(x) = x / 3$ if $x \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$

$C_7(x) = x / 2$ if $x \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$

otherwise $C_7(x) = 7x+1$

The coefficient $C_n$ creates a function behaving in one of the three following ways:

* **Converge**: The function resulting from the coefficient $C_n$ reduces, under iteration, every integer to $1$, resembling the classic $3x+1$ problem.
* **Diverge**: The function causes integers to "explode", and increase rapidly under iteration, with no limit. This is observed in other Collatz-related problems. See $C_{33}$ in larger integers (>500 bits)
* **Non-Trivial Loop**: The function creates at least one non-trivial loop. (A loop is non-trivial if it is not the loop containing $1$) That is, an integer under iteration can enter a loop that prevents the iteration from ever reducing to 1. This is the common failure under our "Strong" generalization.

This generalization produces several well-behaved functions. In this script, $C_3$ (obviously), $C_5$, $C_7$, and $C_{25}$ are observed to "converge", or every element tested in reduction (tens of millions in sequence and in random) converge to the trivial loop surrounding 1. However, other functions, such as $C_9$, $C_{11}$, $C_{13}$ form non-trivial loops, and thus do not converge.

#### GPU Approach

We do three tests using `cuda.py`.
1. Reduce lots of random integers (`RANDOM_NUM_TESTS`, shown below: 10,000,000) of the largest size we can handle (up to 50 bits or so)
2. Reduce every integer from $1$ to some limit (`SERIAL_NUM_TESTS`, shown below: 1,000,000,000) for each candidate coefficient
2. Finally, for each $C_n$ remaining, we attempt to reduce truly large numbers (`RANDOM_CPU_ELEMENT_MIN`, shown below: 2048 bits) in python with the arbitrary precision libraries

What remains are the coefficients that create Strong Collatz functions that converge to $1$ under iteration!

#### CPU Approach

We also do CPU tests using `test_25_cpu.py`.

We are limited to the size of the integers we can reduce when testing due to the lack of arbitrary precision libraries on the GPU. Therefore, we will extend the tests with the CPU for more rigorous tests of larger coefficients.

In `test_25_cpu.py` (meant to test the coefficient $C_{25}$), we run $10,000$ tests reducing integers of size $2^{2048}$.

#### Results

The computed sequence of converging coefficients $\hat{C}$ computed here is:

$\hat{C} = \set{3, 5, 7, 25, 29, 41,...}$

The plan was to compute the sequence of converging functions $C_n$ and compare the sequence to the OEIS. Perhaps in expanding the set of problems to investigate we can learn something about the Collatz conjecture. 

This sequence largely agrees with [A058047](https://oeis.org/A058047), with the exception of $C_{25}$.


#### Regarding $C_{25}$

Several papers reference the source [4] as the source of a prime-coefficient version of the above generalization. This generalization precludes coefficients which seem to converge, like $C_{25}$. I am unable to find a justification for why one would only choose prime coefficients for Strong Collatz formulae, and in fact am unable to find the source [4] at all. The lack of source material is interesting, as source [4] seems to be the source for generalizations in many papers, such as [3].

#### Notes

- These tests were performed on a GTX4080
- The sequence does not end at 41 - the GPU tests begin overflowing on ~45 bit numbers, and the overflows are excluded from the final sequence
- Many of the smaller coefficients that one might expect to converge such as $11, 13, 17$ etc. form non-trivial loops, while the larger coefficients quickly spiral outside the bounds of our GPU calculations.
- It is interesting that $C_{25}$ seems to converge
- $C_{33}$ is tricky, and only very rarely loops, even when testing hundreds of millions of 50 bit numbers - this is worrying as, although we have never seen $C_{25}$ form a non-trivial loop, it could be lurking out there in the large integers. Future implementations of this script will inject known poison integers which show $C_{33}$ to loop. $C_{33}$ is almost always shown to create non-trivial loops in the CPU audit, underscoring the importance of that test.
- See "The $3x+1$  Problem" by Lagarias for a deep dive into the problem - it is an excellent resource
- I was surprised to find [A058047](https://oeis.org/A058047), which was obscured from my background researchbecause of $C_{25}$.
